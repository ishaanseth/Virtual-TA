I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\nThank you and Regards\nAkshit"

We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity."

For ROE and the Week 4 GA, bonus marks were mentioned here on Discourse\nCould you kindly guide me on what exactly we should refer to (such as any email, document, or past policy) and what steps are expected from us to be eligible for the bonus?\nAlso, would students who completed all 5 assignments (but missed GA7) have any alternative way to earn bonus marks through peer reviews or other contributions?\nApologies if I’ve missed something already mentioned. Your clarification would be really helpful for me and others who are in a similar situation.\n@jkmadathil\nThank you so much for your time and guidance.\nWarm regards,\nMishkat Chougule"

I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.\nHowever, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.\nAddressing the queries you raised in your post:\nIn previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.\nI am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.\nI have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:\nFrom the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.\nMy peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.\nUnfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7.\n…\nGiven this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews.\nPlease note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria.\nThank you for your time and consideration\n@jkmadathil\nsir.\nBest regards,\nAkshit Mittal"

    "content": "Yes\n@jkmadathil\nsir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email.\nSince the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the\nTDS course focuses more on teamwork\nand collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and\nmy peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.\nThey were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE\nrelease and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.\nI understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.\nSir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.\nFinally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.\nI’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.\nThank you once again for your understanding."

    "content": "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having:\n23f2004636:\nHere is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:\nEvery term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.\nThe course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.\n192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this\nAs a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).\nWhen we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?\nIt is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort\nbefore\nthere was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.\nOnce again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.\nThe 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie.\nI had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below:\n# Assignments Done\n# students\n0\n42\n1\n33\n2\n22\n3\n19\n4\n23\n5\n28\nAssignment_Score\n# students\n0-10\n75\n11-20\n19\n21-30\n15\n31-40\n9\n41-50\n13\n51-60\n7\n61-70\n11\n71-80\n12\n81-90\n10\n91-100\n17"

    "content": "@jkmadathil\nSir\n,\nThank you for the detailed explanation. I just have one sincere doubt:\nAs you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the\ntotal course marks\n, instead of awarding\n15/100 of the total\nto those who did GA7 exceptionally well?\nStudents like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too?\nIt’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.\nI’m only concerned about\nmy own marks\n, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.\nThank you for your time and understanding.\n@carlton\n@Jivraj"

I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair.\nHowever, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so\nnot\nfor extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.\nNow that bonus marks are announced\nafter\nthe deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.\nI’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later."

    "content": "Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course.\nIf the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4.\nThe main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score.\nSir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they\nattended\nGA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair.\nPlease think from our side.\nRegards\nKarthik"

Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.\nFor students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.\nGiven that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these"

I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised.\njkmadathil:\nWith due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated:\n“I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.”\nAs mentioned above, my intention was never to express\njealousy\n. It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully.\njkmadathil:\nI would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6.\nPersonally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience\n, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter.\nFurther, you mentioned:\njkmadathil:\nI completely respect the effort put in by those students.\nHowever, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.\nIf the bonus is truly a recognition of effort\nspecific to GA7\n, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the\nGA7 score\nonly, not in the\noverall course total\n, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.\nI know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning.\nThank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view."

So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility.\nAnother issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations.\nOnce again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.\nThank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view."

    "content": "@jkmadathil\n@carlton\n@s.anand\n@Jivraj\nSir, as said in this another students’ post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.\nShouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship.\nHow can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.\nJust because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.\nRegards\nKarthik"

    "content": "Hi everyone,\nA bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.\nFirstly students\nvastly\noverestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.\nSo of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.\nOnly 2 students managed it.\nGoing by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6\nmight\nhave even managed to get 3 or more marks.\nSo lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.\nThe mean bonus score was 1.27.\nSo, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.\nThat is the data for you.\nStudent Bonus\n600×371 7.62 KB\nAlso noteworthy\nBonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.\nNone of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?\nBonuses are always surprise opportunities that are\nnot\nwidely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!\nBonuses are not a right.\nThey are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.\nHowever we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:"

    "content": "Hi\n@carlton\nsir and\n@Jivraj\nsir,\nSir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded. While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.\nAdditionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.\nGiven these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted\nSir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts."

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\nThese things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\nKindest regards"

If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.\nIf students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.\nWe have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.\nKind regards"

Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.\nAlso just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.\nIf yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.\nKind regards"

    "content": "@Jivraj\n@carlton\nI’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.\nI have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.\nThese are the detailed point wise concerns :\nI at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.\nBy this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.\nI understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.\nI also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.\nI have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.\nKindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.\nI hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.\nThanks and Regards"

During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between\npandas\nand\nnumpy\ncaused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (\npandas==2.0.3\nand\nnumpy==1.24.3\n) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (\nsantoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\n). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.\nThank you for your assistance!"

    "content": "Hi\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\nI might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe_open function that will throw a HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?\nThanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this"

If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.\nKind regards"

    "content": "@Jivraj\n@Carlton\nI completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.\nHowever, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.\nimage\n1272×395 25.7 KB\nBut here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*\nImplementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper\nReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models\n.\nImplementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.\nEnhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.\nAdding useful API endpoints, including an\n/api/\nmultipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing\n/read\nand\n/run\nendpoints from Project 1, plus a\n/clear\nendpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.\nDeploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP\n, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.\nAll this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like\nhyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents\n, and it would do that for you—without\never\ndeclining the request. I like to think of it as a\nterminal version of\nOpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent\n.\nGiven all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project\nnaturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)\nand not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.\nTo clarify,\nall the updates mentioned above took place after March 29\n,\nafter Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.\nFurthermore, we were\nnever informed\nthat a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.\nMy only request is that if my\nupdated P1 submission cannot be evaluated\ndue to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my\noriginal P1 eval score could be reinstated\ninstead of receiving a\n0\n—since it was already evaluated and graded.\nWould highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard\n@carlton\n@Jivraj"

    "content": "We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.\nWe discussed it internally with\n@s.anand\nand he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it\nregardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not\non the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.\nIn our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by\n@s.anand\nSo unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.\nKind regards,\nTDS team"

I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.\nI am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.\nAdditionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.\nGiven this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.\nScreenshot 2025-04-01 020618\n1335×667 57.9 KB"

    "content": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation,\n@carlton\n. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.\nRegarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible\nwithin the scope of the problem statement\n.\nWhat began as just another (pun intended)\ntedious\nassignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents.\n(…caution: long post ahead\n)\nI noticed that\ntest cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use\n. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the\ninherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads\n. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.\nSome might suggest using\ntemperature=0\nto get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.\nHardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers\n: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.\nAt the core of it, it’s all about\nhow much flexibility vs rigidity\nwe give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.\nSince most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,\nReason about the task, understand intent,\nReflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e.\ndesign\na DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)\nExecute those workflows (\nwalk\nthe DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.\nObserve the final result, and repeat if needed.\nInterestingly, a similar framework was suggested in\nthis ICLR 2022 paper\n. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.\nTo make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of\ngeneral-purpose tools\n:\nA REPL executor (for quick calcs)\nA Python script runner\nA Shell executor\nWith just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.\nAs for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was\nemergent behavior\n, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research.\nFrankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!\nI am actually very thankful to the TDS course team &\n@s.anand\nfor devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with.\nFood for thought! Really!\nAs for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.\nPS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects:\nthoughtful use of LLMs in agent design\n. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.\nTL;DR\nMy approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.\nKind regards"

These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.\nHowever, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.\nI acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.\nAction Taken\nTo address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:\nThe application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.\nIt responds to requests within the required timeframe.\nI have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:\nDocker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\nRequest for Re-Evaluation\nI kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.\nPrevious Message for Reference\nFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:\n\"Greetings, Sir,\nI would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.\nThank you for your assistance!\""

We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes."

However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.\nHad it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.\nWith utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject."

We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.\nWe are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.\nA minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.\nCritical failures prevents everything else from working\nand thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.\nI know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.\nKindest regards"

    "content": "@carlton\n@jivraj\n@s.anand\n,\nI hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.\nI understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.\nI do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.\nI sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.\nI know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.\nThank you for your time and understanding."

At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.\nScreenshot 2025-04-07 233513\n805×197 9.52 KB\nGithub repo submitted:\nGitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent\nDocker repo submitted:\nwasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent\nThe previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the\napp.py\nfile could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.\nI would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the\napp.py\nfile does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:\nhttps://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py\n.\nBut as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only:\nhttps://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent\n.\nHumbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.\nI’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.\nThank You and Regards,\n24ds3000090"

Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.\nEdit 2:\nEven if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.\nimage\n1027×510 11 KB\nThough an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task.

Anyway thanks and appreciate all the help"

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n1. Graded Assignments (GA)\nGA6 Doubts Unresolved:\nWhile doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided.\n(Thread link)\nGA Platform Changes:\nInitially, we were solving questions on\nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n. However, in GA6, we moved to\nSeek\nand in GA7, to\nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n2. Project Updates\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 2:\nThere are multiple doubts posted in the\nProject 2\ndiscussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?\n(thread link)\n3. ROE Score Update\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\nBest regards,\nLakshay"

But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\nlakshaygarg654:\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\nlakshaygarg654:\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\nKind regards"

We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.\nLooking forward to your response.\nRegards,\nLakshay"

The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance\n10418 meters\n12287 meters\n10965 meters\n11149 meters\nWhose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)\nAlso, my question 4 was :\nAs an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.\n134483\n94774\n150666\n199711\nWhose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect\nSo is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)\nKindly look into it\nThanks and Regards"

    "content": "@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nDear Sir,\nI have few questions. It is written in the\nTools in Data Science\nthat we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.\nIn GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI\ngh\nwhich we have to install in the vercel instance using\napt\npackage manager.\nBut, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.\nIn GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?\nAlso after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install\nngrok\npackage.\nIn GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires\ndocker\npackage installed.\nIn GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?\nMany ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?\nAnd many more\nMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.\nVercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.\nMany of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.\nI can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.\nAlso, some ques requires external toolings like\nIn GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.\nIn GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?\nGA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally.\nHow to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.\nAlso, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like\nIn GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.\nSome ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?\nAnother concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from\nhttps://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev\nwill be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.\nPlease advise what we should do. please clarify Sir."

Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.\nCurrently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.\nThe first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.\nCan you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?\nHow do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.\nThanks and Regards\nShalini"

For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.\nAlternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.\nAdditionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.\nYour editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.\nVisual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.\nTo get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:\nGetting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)\nCode Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)\nProductivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)\nPersonalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)\nExtensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)\nDebugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)\nVersion Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)\nCustomize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)\nAI Editors: Copilot, Cursor\nNote: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.\nTo install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type\ncode -s\n, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.\nWhat is the output of\ncode -s\n? The output of\ncode -s\ncannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.\nAs for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.\nimage\n1214×831 34.8 KB"

When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?\nOr\nSometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this :\nhttps://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png\nThis link was take from GA2 Question 2\nHTML AND TABLE\nSome questions have\nhtml\nand\ntables\n. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.\nExample for string. Consider the table\nCol 1\nCol 2\nRow 1, Col1\nRow 1 Col 2\nRow 2, Col 1\nRow 2 Col 2\nWill this be something like this\n\"|Col 1| Col 2|\\n|-|-|\\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\"\nor something like\n\"<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Col 1</th>\\n<th>Col 2</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\n\"\nHIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS\nIn one question, there were two tasks.\nFind the answer to the question\nEnable the\ndisabled\ntext block\nIn this question, what will the answer type be?\nShould it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block\nMORE THAN ONE FILE\nSome questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link\nhttps://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp\nand a table.\nIn this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this\ncurl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\\n  -F \"question=question text\" \\\n  -F \"file= Image file\" \\\n  -F \"file= table file/ string\"\nCORS HEADERS\nWill the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?"

    "content": "@carlton\nand\n@jivraj\n,\nHello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..\nI have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you."

However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different.

But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.\nIn\nGA4 Q2\n, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe.\nimage\n1674×420 24.3 KB\nimage\n1118×358 63.7 KB\nPlease check the issue in the images provided.

Kindly verify these points before evaluation.\nQuestions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue\nGA3 Q8\nIssue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.\nGA3 Q9\nIssue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.\nClarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?\nGA4 Q2 & Q10\nIssue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.\nReference:\nGA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution\nOutput Formatting (Multiple Questions)\nIssue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.\nNote: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.\nVercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions\nIssue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.\nClarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?\nDeployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session)\nPlease include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:\nPlatform Capability for GA Tasks\nWhich cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?\nNote: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.\nFile Upload Example via Platform API\nRequest: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.\nThis would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.\nGeneral Observations on GA1-5\nOutput Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.\nKindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side."

Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.\nAll the best for your OPPE and your Project 2"

    "content": "@carlton\n,\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nGA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages\nAs part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address\n21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\nin the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.\nTo automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.\nHowever, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a\n502 Bad Gateway\nerror, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.\nGA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files\nA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a\n502 Bad Gateway\nerror on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\nCurrently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.\nBelow Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.\nimage\n1854×493 55.9 KB"

    "content": "@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nFinal Thoughts on Project 2\nProject 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.\nOrganization & Structure:\nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.\nDeployment & Portal Limitations:\nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.\nTime Constraints:\nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.\nSessions & Support:\nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.\nDeployment Variability:\nEach GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.\nEffort Acknowledgment:\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.\nFeasibility in the Given Timeline:\nEven for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.\nI genuinely hope someone is able to complete\nall 57 questions\nsuccessfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.\nAgain, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.\nThank you for the learning opportunity"

In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.\nHow should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help.\n@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\nAlso, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.\nIt would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.\nI believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else."

If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done."

    "content": "Hello Sir,\nI want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using\nvicky_server.py\n, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses.\nMy mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.\nHowever, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem?\nFurthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes\nfirst.py\nfor GA1.\nThank you for the opportunity to work on this project!\nBest regards,\nvicky kumar\n@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Saransh_Saini\nmy model at\nVicky kumar tds"

    "content": "@Saransh_Saini\n@Jivraj\n@carlton\nWhat is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.\nFor 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.\nSo I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.\nQuestion —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?\nEdit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.\nRegards,\nShivaditya"

    "content": "I reuesting to all my teachers\n@s.anand\n,\n@carlton\n,\n@Jivraj\n,\n@Saransh_Saini\nplease reply me.\nWhat is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\nThankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’."

    "content": "Dear Shahzada,\nYou joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)\nThe first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.\n23f2002668:\nI am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.\n23f2002668:\nWe have made\nseveral hours of videos\non Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.\n23f2002668:\nNot sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)\n23f2002668:\nYes these were explained if you\neither took part in any live session or\nwatched the recorded video\n23f2002668:\nI am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.\n23f2002668:\nProject 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:\nCreate a server api that receives a request.\nThe request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.\nThe response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.\nMultiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.\n23f2002668:\nSince this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.\nIf you want solutions, there are several options:\nAsk for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)\nCollaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)\nJoin live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)\nWatch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)\n23f2002668:\nThis is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.\nThe biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.\n23f2002668:\nIf you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.\nBut feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.\nWhat are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.\nI absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.\n23f2002668:\nReading documentation is a skill you have to pick up.\nHaving said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.\nJust ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.\nNow is a good time to start.\n23f2002668:\nThat is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.\n23f2002668:\nThey have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.\nLuckily for you,\nour first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).\n23f2002668:\nIf you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.\n23f2002668:\nAnand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?\nAlso if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.\nBut validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.\nYou can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.\n23f2002668:\nI am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither\nrespect\nnor\nkindness\nis evident in your post.\nBut thank you for your feedback.\nOne final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.\nAnd when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.\nKind regards,\nTDS team"

    "content": "Hi, I have a few things to say\nMy background :\nI have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.\nMy Initial Disappointments with this Course\nIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):\nHere, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph\nROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.\nThere are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.\nWhy did I fail?\nLast Term\nI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.\nThis term.\nI made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.\nIn both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.\nMe Understanding about the Course Now\nThis one line changed my view about ROE.\nOn another topic\nI am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.\nI scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.\nNow I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.\nIn MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing\nSKLearn\n. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.\nThis course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an\nimplicit\nway.\nThis is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.\nI have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks\nI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.\nI am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.\nFrom the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.\nSince this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.\nThanks to\n@s.anand\n,\n@carlton\n,\n@Jivraj\nand\n@Saransh_Saini\nI feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.\nWhile introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us."

While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.\nCould you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue?

    "content": ":\nFrom Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras\nProject Demo Website\n:\nhttps://app.algsoch.tech\nDuring our college course\nTool for Data Science (TDS)\nat\nIIT Madras\n, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project:\nto build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API\n.\nThe Mission:\nCreate a tool that behaves like a\nchatbot\n, accepts\nuser queries (text or file-based)\nvia\nweb or API\n, processes them intelligently,\nexecutes the appropriate code\n, and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant.\nThe Journey: From Fails to Final\nAt first, the natural choice was to try\nLLM agents\n—they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries.\nThen I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a\nstatic JSON structure\n? That quickly broke when users passed\ndifferent parameters, different files\n, or queried in\nnon-standard formats\nlike “code -s” or “code -v”.\nThe next idea: write\nindividual Python scripts per question\nfrom our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.\nThe Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping\nAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:\nCentralized engine in\nvicky_server.py\nUses\nregex-based pattern matching\nto detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution\nEach solution is a structured Python function like\nga1_first_solution(query=None)\nSupports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more\nActs like a\nmini compiler for data science tools\nPresenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS\nVicky is a\nsmart, modular chatbot\nbuilt specifically for\nTool for Data Science at IIT Madras\n. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates.\nKey Features:\nGraded Assignment Solver\nHandles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:\ncode -s\n/\ncode -v\n→ VS terminal commands\nCreate FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching\nGitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup\nData cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression\nFile Upload with Query Matching\nUsers can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.\nHTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder\nView any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy\nUpload Base64 string → Get original image back\nWebhooks Integration\nLive notifications via\nDiscord\n&\nSlack\nwhenever\n/api\nendpoints are accessed\nMonitors\nserver status (online/offline)\nand sends real-time updates\nLLM Download + Auto Tunneling\nDownloads LLaMA models\nDynamically finds available ports\nCreates and exposes tunneled endpoints\nLive Web UI at\napp.algsoch.tech\nAsk any TDS question\nUpload and query with files\nImage decoder\nGraded assignment slider navigation\nHTML viewer\nAPI health status\nBuilt With:\nFastAPI\nfor blazing fast APIs\nRegex & Pattern Matching\nfor dynamic input detection\nGitHub Copilot\n+ my Python debugging and architectural thinking\nFull webhook and status monitoring system\nModular backend (\nvicky_server.py\n) and web frontend (\nvicky_app.py\n)\nI want to extend a huge thank you to\n@s.anand\nfor their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead.\nNow I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project"

During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to\n@Saransh_Saini\n.\nIt seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.\nWe just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.\nWe hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.\nThank you\nLakshay"

These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do??"

As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests.\nThe app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response\nWhen POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests\na. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response\nb. https://…/api  → resulted in a 307\nwhereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/”\nThe logs from Cloud Run\nimage\n982×552 133 KB\nAs you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).\nimage\n831×645 41.7 KB\nI request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nShivaditya"

And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.\nThis is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)"

    "content": "@carlton\n,\n@Saransh_Saini\nsir my roll number is 23f2004462\nDue to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok’s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.\nNew project 2 url:-\nhttps://96c8-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/"

I had sent\nhttps://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/\nas updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests  were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?"

As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately\n50 to 60 seconds\nto activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both\nPodman\nand\nLinux\nenvironments.\nUpon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on\nRailway\nand submitted that link as well.\nIf possible, I kindly request either of the following:\nRe-evaluation using the\nRailway link\nI provided, or\nRe-evaluation using the\nRender link\n, with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time.\nYour consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.\nThank you for your support and guidance."

But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.\nPlease re consider this request sir."

I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.\nEven after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.\nEven if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.\nPlease consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted\nrollnumber 23f2001390"

    "content": "Dear\n@jkmadathil\n@Anand\n@Bharathi\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the\nTDS team\nin supporting us throughout this course. The\nlive sessions and guidance\nhave been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\nKey Challenges Faced\nLack of Prerequisites\nThis course did not list any\nprerequisites\n, leading many students—including those from\nnon-technical backgrounds\n—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the\ncourse content, assignments, and projects\nhave been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\nThe\ndifficulty of the projects\nhas been overwhelming, requiring most of us to\nrely heavily on peer support\njust to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\nMany students joined\nTDS\nbased on past\nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for\nworking professionals\nand students without prior experience.\nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending\n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\nto secure good scores—we still find ourselves\nstruggling to meet expectations\nfor the\nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives."

    "content": "Hi\n@s.anand\n@jkmadathil\n@Bharathi\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nCould you please look into the above issue?\nAdditionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:\nGrading Concerns\nFinal Course Score:\nT = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F\n(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)\nFrom the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:\nWhat’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?\n.\nGiven this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.\nFurthermore, for Project 1 (\ndeadline: 16th Feb 2025\n), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\nMany students pursuing this course are\ndual-degree students or working professionals\n, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\nThe\nlast-minute guidance\nfor projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\nThe\nstructuring and scheduling of sessions\nfeel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\nRequest for Improvement\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2\n, well in advance of the deadline.\nMore structured and accessible support\n, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels\n, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response."

    "content": "Thank you\n@A_LAKSHMI\nfor the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the\ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this\nDiscourse thread\nwhere students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the\nfirst page of the TDS course\nGA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -\nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\nAgain to quote Anand:\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a\nnice blog\nwhere [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -\nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\nThe point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n@22f2001640\nManagement of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity."

    "content": "Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\nI’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.\nWhile grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass."

The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\nThe chaos of ROE.\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\nHow limited the time is.\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\nKind regards"

Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions.

    "content": "Respected\n@s.anand\n,\n@Jivraj\n,\n@carlton\nBased on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.\nAs you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.\nI genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.\nYour understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.\nBest Regards,\nLakshay"

We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\nThe problem is the lack of time.\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.\nProject 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\nKind regards"

ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann”\nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\nKind regards"

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \""

(On 15th Feb 1:26AM)\nThen when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.\nThen once you realised your mistake, on\nFeb 17th at 9:11 pm IST\ni.e\nyesteday\n, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.\nThen you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]\nimage\n250×534 3.92 KB\n[/quote]\nshowing that your files are in the correct place.\nWe do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.\nKind regards"

I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner.

So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.\nI am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.\nNow, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks.

    "content": "Hi Vikram,\nThis is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\nRun evalute.py using uv.\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\nHope that gives clarity.\nKind regards"

Here are the highlights of the discussion:\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\nKind regards\nTDS Team"

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\nThank you."

    "content": "Sir,\nI would like to inquire if it would be possible to reconsider the weightage of the projects. As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2.\nThis adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.\nWould it be possible to implement this change?"

    "content": "@lakshaygarg654\nYour query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.\nQuery construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.\nIn this case its an ordered\npost_id\nSo thats where you begin:\nSELECT post_id\nFROM (\n...\n)\nORDER BY post_id\nDoing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.\nThen at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.\nYou will still need the\npost_id\nfor the\noutermost layer\nso you have to continue extracting it from the\ninner layers\nof the nested query.\n...\n...\nFROM (\n   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars\n   FROM social_media\n   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)\n      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)\n)\n...\n...\nThen the final layer of the nest\n...\n...\n(\n\n) as max_stars\n...\n...\nYou are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)\nBut I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.\nThink clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Thank you for your response\n@carlton\n. You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:\njson_extract\n:\n“Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”\njson_each\n:\n“Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”\njson_extract_path_text\n:\n“Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”\nSince the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.\nI would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for\nQ8\n.\nThankyou"

    "content": "QUESTION 9\nI was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \""

    "content": "Hi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards"

I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.\nI use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?\nIn Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.\nI would appreciate your guidance on these issues."

    "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently."

    "content": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\nIsolation\n– Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\nReproducibility\n– A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\nPortability\n– You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\nUsing requirements.txt\n• Best for\nreproducibility\nand\ncollaboration\nsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n• If you\ndon’t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n• If you\ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n• Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a\nrequirements.txt\nfile for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\nKind regards"

But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n24f2006531:\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed."

The keys to a successful Project 1 are:\nDeliverables,\nand\nan example\nof the Evaluation has been provided.\nIf your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.\nScreenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am\n1764×1764 374 KB\nPlease read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.\nSo the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.\nKind regards"

Is this fine?\nFor /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?\nAre we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?\nFor tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible?

    "content": "Hi Andrew,\nYou have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.\nI just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.\nIn other words getting 10/10 in\nevaluate.py\ndoes NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.\nSo do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of\nevaluate.py\n. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general\nidea\nof the task.\nThat said,\nevaluate.py\nis a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).\nHope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)\nA word of caution:\n(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)\nYour requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (\npossibly your first task\n) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.\nKind regards"

I have raised this issue before\nHence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.\nI just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project).

Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+\n(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)\nfor us!\nThe budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.\nIn short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill.

No need to worry about it.\nAnother Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.\ncreate a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv\nadd this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location\nand run source .bashrc.

Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.\n@carlton\nSir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.\nTherefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.\nI sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support."

When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.\nI have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.\nI am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.\nI beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.\nThank you for considering my heartfelt request.\nSincerely,\nRishit Jain\n(24F2004595)"

However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.\nSir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?"

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable."

That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.\nIn such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount."

    "content": "Hello,\nI am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?"

I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You"

    "content": "@23F300327\nYou would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.\nGA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.\nNow typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.\nAlso the live sessions on\nyoutube\nwill address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.\nThere will be session\n2025-01-20T14:30:00Z\n→\n2025-01-20T16:30:00Z\nwhich will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.\nThe session is in your course calendar and the meet link is\nmeet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy\nKind regards"

    "content": "@23F300327\nTypically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.\nWhen a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api\nwith parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.\nThe rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.\nThat’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this\n# api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\n        self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\n        return\nNotice there is no\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\ncode block.\nThis would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nis used to execute some code\nonly\nif the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.\nTry rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default\nhandler\nclass. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.\nAnother possible problem:\nBy default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues\nTDS > Development Tools > unicode\nSo converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.\nLet us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.\nKind regards"

Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.\nFor deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to\nthis guide on DEV Community\n.

    "content": "@23f1002382\nNothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.\nThat being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.\nMost of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!\nSo we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.\nIn the meanwhile:\nThere are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Hi Srividya,\nThats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.\nWhen the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.\nThis renders\nname == main\npart of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).\nIn other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You\ndo not\ncreate serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.\nThis is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.\nThanks for your input.\nKind regards"

When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.\nDo I need to do anything else ?\nSecondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.\nThird, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards."

With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection."

So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server.\n@s.anand\nwill be able to confirm the reason for this problem.\nFor the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.\nKind regards"
